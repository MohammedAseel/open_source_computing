license-reasoning.txt

We chose the Mozilla Public License v2 becasue it is a flexible, permissive, open-source license that is compatible on a file-by-file basis with the GPLv2.

This allows for other projects to include individual modules of our code in their GPLv2 or MOZv2 licensed projects without permission.

This also allows us to rely on a trusted standard (Mozilla) for our legal needs.
